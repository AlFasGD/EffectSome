## Q&A
### What is EffectSome?
EffectSome is a program that is aiming to help creators of Geometry Dash do their job easier.

In other terms, this is a level editor expansion tool, offering multiple external functions that the in-game level editor lacks.

### How can this program help creators?
Our target is to offer the creators the most useful tools that are not in the game.

There are some level creators of the game that are demanding and the in-game level editor cannot fully satisfy their needs.
This often has as a result to delay levels for up to full months.

EffectSome is the expansion program that offers these demanding creators more tools to play around with and also do their
job faster and without any boredom.

### Is this program some sort of hack?
This program cannot be directly called a hack, but you can technically say it is since it is tweaking the gamesave and memory.
However it is not a "hack" with the bad meaning.

It is a useful sort of "hack", just as you would call the object limit bypass (which is a hack).

### Does the program get any personal information?
We want to see who's using EffectSome so that we know whether the program has reached its target,
so the program gathers some user information that will be only used for statistical purposes.

The information that EffectSome is gathering are the following: Saved Song IDs, User Name, User ID, Account ID.

The entire project is published and that is proof enough only the information that the published code gathers is actually gathered.

The project is never planned to gather your password, email, or any other private information. (GDPR compliant)
